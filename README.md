The purpose of this modelling is to investigate what is affecting breeding success of the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), in an effort to understand drivers of reproductive sucess and population-level patterns of genetic diversity. Prior investigation using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (genetic data) has provided us with a pedigree for all known quolls in Mulligan's Flat Woodland Sanctuary, from which we have been able to determine some reproductive patterns. What remains uncertain is what makes a 'good' quoll: that is, what traits lead to higher reproductive success/output?

Generally, we're asking the question "What affects breeding in the population" in a hurdle-model approach.
1. Of the morphological and genetic factors possessed by an individual (colour, heterozygosity, etc), which affect breeding success?
2. For individuals that breed successfully, do any traits influence the number of offspring produced?

Note that in this analysis "successful" production of offspring is equivalent to recruiting offspring into the next generation, rather than conception/birth being the endpoint. This is because individuals can only be captured and  microchipped/sampled if they survive from birth to dispersal from the natal den.
